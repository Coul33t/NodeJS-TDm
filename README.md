# NodeJS-TDm

This is the code for the fifth TDm, using Node.js.

The repository is structured as follows :
```
initial_code :        The course's code, provided as is.
initial_code_redone : The course's code, rewritten by myself, and commented.
minimal_code :        The minimal code (without separation) to run a server.
q1 :                  Answer to the first question.
q2 :                  Answer to the second question.
q3 :                  Answer to the third question.
```

Please try by yourself, before reading the solution. A good starting point would be looking at the `initial_code_redone` and `minimal_code` folders.
