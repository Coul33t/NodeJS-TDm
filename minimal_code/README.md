`index_1.js` : The minimal " classic " code to run a server, plus a couple of examples (you'll most likely see this kind of code when looking for Node.js example).

`index_2.js` : The minimal code to run a server, rewritten and with some comments which explains the differences.

`index_3.js` : The most " natural " code to run a server, closer to the way you're probably used to write code.
